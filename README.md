Some of my programs that i wrote to help me at university


I'm a mechanical engineering student and i was needing something that could help me with some repetitive calculations

The many sites in the internet and the slowly way of inputing it makes me wrote my own code, where i can access all the the calculations i need in one place with a very easy way to send inputs

The code is not perfect, it could be hard to use it for someone else since it don't have explanations and it uses my accent to communicate. But it helps me a lot during the firsts semesters at the university
